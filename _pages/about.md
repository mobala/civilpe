My name is Mohammed Bala and I'm a Civil Engineer from Los Angeles. I've got a passion for structures, web development, learning new things, and organized spaces. I've started this blog to share as much as I can about my work to anyone interested enough to read. If you've got comments or questions about anything you see on the blog, I'm always happy to chat. You can reach me at mohammedbala@icloud.com.
